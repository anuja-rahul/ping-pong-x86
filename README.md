# Ping Pong Game x86 Assembly üèì

This project contains assembly code for a simple ping pong game written in NASM (Netwide Assembler). The program is designed to run in a 16-bit real mode environment and demonstrates basic graphics programming by drawing paddles and a ball on the screen, handling keyboard input, and implementing game logic.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have NASM and QEMU installed on your system. These tools are used to assemble and run the assembly code.

### Prerequisites

- NASM (Netwide Assembler)
- QEMU (Quick Emulator)

### Installation

You can install NASM and QEMU using the following commands:

#### On Ubuntu/Debian

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nasm qemu
```

#### On Windows

Download and install NASM and QEMU from their official websites:

- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/)
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)

## Files

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `cmd.txt`: Contains commands to assemble and run the example assembly code.
- `x86ASM/buildSingleASM.bat`: A batch script to assemble and run a specified assembly file.
- `x86ASM/buildASM.bat`: A batch script to assemble and run multiple assembly files.
- `x86ASM/example.asm`: The main assembly file containing the code to set the video mode and jump to the second sector.
- `x86ASM/exampleS2.asm`: The second sector assembly file containing the code to handle keyboard input, draw paddles, and move the ball.

## Usage

To assemble and run the example assembly code, you can use the provided batch script or the commands in `cmd.txt`.

### Using the Batch Script

Navigate to the `x86ASM` directory and run the batch script with the name of the assembly file (without the extension) as an argument:

```sh
cd x86ASM
.\buildSingleASM.bat example
```

### Using the Commands in `cmd.txt`

Alternatively, you can manually run the commands listed in `cmd.txt`:

```sh
nasm -f bin example.asm -o example.bin
qemu-system-x86_64 -fda example.bin
```

## Assembly Files

<details>
<summary>
<code>x86ASM/example.asm</code></summary>

### Description

This assembly file contains code to set the video mode to 320x200 with 256 colors and draw a moving square on the screen.

---

### Functionality

- **Initialization**: Sets up the data segment, stack segment, and video mode.
- **Drawing the Square**: Calculates the starting position and dimensions of the square, then draws it pixel by pixel.
- **Timer Interrupt**: Moves the square horizontally across the screen.
- **Infinite Loop**: Keeps the program running indefinitely.

<summary>
<code>x86ASM/exampleS2.asm</code></summary>

### Description

This assembly file contains code to handle keyboard input, draw paddles, move the ball, and manage game logic for a simple ping pong game.

---

### Functionality

- **Initialization**: Sets up the timer and keyboard interrupt handlers.
- **Keyboard Handling**: Processes key presses to move the paddles.
- **Drawing Functions**: Draws the paddles and the ball on the screen.
- **Game Logic**: Moves the ball, checks for collisions, and updates the game state.
- **Timer Interrupt**: Updates the game state at regular intervals.
